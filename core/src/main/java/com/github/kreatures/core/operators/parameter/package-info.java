/**
 * 	This package contains base classes for parameter of the 
 * 	operators defined in kreatures.core.operators, we differentiate
 * 	between the GenericOperatorParameter and the classes implementing
 * 	OperatorParameter. The former is a simple string to object map and
 * 	the later can use an instance of GenericOperatorParameter to read 
 * 	their own data and provide an interface to the operator developer
 * 	that allows the easy usage of parameters.
