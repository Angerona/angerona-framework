/**
 * A PlanElement is the data-structure saved as step in a plan. It decouples the behavior of the plan
 * from its data. The intention member contains the behavior either as atomic Skill or complex Subgoal.
 * 
 * For a Skill the PlanElement encapsulates the execution. It provides the prepare method which sets the correct
 * data dependencies before running the Skill. It sets the used beliefs and registers the ActionProcessor which is
 * responsible to perform the actions (might be mental or physical). It also saves a executionData object which
 * contains the input-data for the Skill. In the simplest case this object is an Action and the skill does nothing
 * else then send the action to the ActionProcessor.
 * 
 * The PlanElement also contains a userData object which saves simulation specific data for later use. For example
 * could one save a boolean indicating if the PlanElement represents a lie and give it a higher cost if it is a lie.
