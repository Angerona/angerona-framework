	This scenario uses two secrets and therefore shows that the answer is selected that has the lowest sum 
	of secret weakening. Alice answers said(youLied) first because it weakens no secret but then she has to 
	decide between said(husbandWifeScandal) that only weakens on secret and said(YouOwe) that weakens both
	secrets, such that the sum of secret weakening is greater. Therefore Alice chooses said(husbandWifeScandal)
	instead of said(husbandWifeScandal) as in the 'No Witness version'.
