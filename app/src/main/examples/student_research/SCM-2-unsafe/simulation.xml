	<description>
	This scenario uses the unsafe version of the know-how plan generation. Therefore the employee gives answers
	that reveal his secrets.
	- The employee tells the boss that he has to be excused for the next day
	- The boss asks the employee why he needs the excuse
	- The employee answers that he attends a sport event
	- The boss knows that this employee is in no sport club and therefore identifies the 
	  lie and tells the employee that he is on the blacklist.
